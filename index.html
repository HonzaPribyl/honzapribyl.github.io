    <h1>Jan PÅ™ibyl</h1>
    <h3 class="pink">Freelancer in multimedia</h3>
    I am a freelance graphic designer who from time to time also takes photos and delivers trainigs on both soft skills and
    graphic design skills. I will gladly help you with any hobby project which you would consider my skills suitable for.
    <div></div>
    I believe in doing things out of joy and enjoying the process. Thanks to this attitude I was managing graphic design department
    of a non-profit organisation, created a bunch of promotional materials and several comic stories.

    <h3>Logo design</h3>
    Logo is a picture associated with a specific entity for example a company. It is a main symbol that is being associated
    with the idea and values of a company. Truly a core element of the visual identity which should have careful attention.
